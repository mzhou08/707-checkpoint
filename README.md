# 10-707 Final Project Code

`youtube-curiosity` contains code for video scraping and download.
`vllama2` contains code for video tokenization and model training.

The preliminary dataset used for this project is contained in `handin.tar.gz`.
`train.json` contains 50,000 examples from
the ~700 videos sampled, and
`train-small.json` contains the smaller dataset (about 8,000 examples)
used to train the "teacher" MLP used to filter data.
